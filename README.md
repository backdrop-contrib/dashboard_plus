Dashboard Plus
==============

The intent of this module is to provide a set of additional blocks for the existing Dashboard module in core. A set of blocks that are generally useful, but may not meet the criteria for inclusion in core. These blocks might eventually be added to core if they prove popular and useful enough. 

At this point, we are looking for good ideas for blocks to include in this module, please use the issue queue to submit requests.
